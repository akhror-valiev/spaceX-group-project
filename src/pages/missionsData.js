    description: "Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon, carried out by NASA in 1969. The mission was commanded by Neil Armstrong and it also included Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. Armstrong became the first human to walk on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, and Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. The mission fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's goal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which he had announced in 1961.",

    description: "Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977. Its mission was to study the outer Solar System and interstellar space. It has been in operation for over 43 years and is still sending back data. Voyager 1 has visited Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest moon, Titan. It has also studied various other moons of Saturn, as well as the rings of Saturn. In 2012, Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space, and it continues to transmit data back to Earth to this day.",

    description: "Sputnik 1 was the first artificial Earth satellite. It was launched by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, and orbited the Earth for three weeks. The launch of Sputnik 1 was a major achievement for the Soviet Union and marked the beginning of the Space Age. It was also a significant event in Cold War history as it demonstrated the technological superiority of the Soviet Union over the United States and sparked the so-called 'Sputnik crisis.' The satellite was about the size of a beach ball and weighed only 183 pounds.",

    description: 'Mariner 2 was a NASA spacecraft launched on August 27, 1962. It was the first successful planetary flyby, as it flew by Venus on December 14, 1962, and provided the first data about the Venusian atmosphere and surface conditions. It was also the first successful interplanetary mission. The spacecraft was launched on an Atlas-Centaur rocket and flew by Venus at a distance of about 21,600 miles. Mariner 2 returned valuable information about the Venusian atmosphere and surface conditions, including the extremely high surface temperature.',

    description: 'Hayabusa, also known as MUSES-C, was a Japanese spacecraft that was launched on May 9, 2003, with the mission to collect samples from the asteroid 25143 Itokawa and return them to Earth. The spacecraft successfully landed on the asteroid in 2005 and collected samples, but it encountered problems on its return journey and returned to Earth in 2010 with a smaller amount of samples than expected. Nevertheless, the mission was considered a success and the samples returned by Hayabusa were the first asteroid samples ever returned to Earth.',

    description: "Curiosity is a car-sized rover designed to explore the Gale crater on Mars as part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission (MSL). It was launched on November 26, 2011 and landed on Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater on Mars on August 6, 2012. The rover's goals include investigation of the Martian climate and geology, and the search for evidence of past or present water, and microbial life. The rover is still active and continues to send data to Earth.",

    description: "Chang'e 3 was a Chinese lunar exploration mission that landed a rover, named Yutu, on the Moon's surface. It was launched on December 1, 2013 and landed on December 14, 2013. It was the first lunar soft landing since 1976 and the first spacecraft to touch down on the Moon's surface since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 in 1976. Chang'e 3 was also the first Chinese spacecraft to land on an extraterrestrial body and the first to carry a rover to the surface of an extraterrestrial body.",
